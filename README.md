# Data Modeling
- By examining the provided CSV, an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables schech `employee_ERD_Skech.png`

# Data Engineering
### Creating Tables:
- Tables such as departments, employees, salaries, titles, dept_emp, and dept_manager are created to model the data.
- Columns and data types are defined for each table.
- Primary keys and foreign keys are established to maintain data integrity and relationships between tables.
### Populating Tables:

# Data Analysis
### Querying Data:
- Various SQL queries are performed to extract meaningful insights from the data stored in the database.
- Queries include retrieving employee information, department details, salary data, and performing filtering and aggregation.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Tasks such as finding employees hired in specific years, identifying managers of departments, and analyzing employee last name frequencies fall under EDA.
